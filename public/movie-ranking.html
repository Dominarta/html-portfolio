<h1>The Best Movies According to LG</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Along Came Polly</h3>
<p>Some of the humour in Along Came Polly is a little much for me, but the Ben Stiller/Jennifer Aniston bond makes up for it, though you can debate how believable a pairing they are.</p>
<h3>Rocky</h3>
<p>Ever since it first came out in 1976 and subsequently won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1977, Rocky developed a sort of reputation as one of the greatest sports films of all time.</p>
<h3>Casino Royale</h3>
<p>Casino Royale is one of the most iconic James Bond movies, as it features a star-studded cast, beautiful locations, and of course, the intriguing casino world!</p>
